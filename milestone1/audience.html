        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>The primary audience is U.S. based users because I plan on sending the website to U.S. based
            recruiters</p>
        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>I would like my website to be able to be navigated by people of all ages but I would say the intended
            audience are people between the ages of 20-30</p>
        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>I expect the majority of users to be pretty evenly spread out between male and female users</p>
        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>I expect many users to be technically savy users so I can inculude some more advanced features that I
            probably wouldnt include in a website for less savy users</p>
