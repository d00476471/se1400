                <p>Visually a lot of websites I have seen are very stunning with lots of colors and menus and movement
                </p>

            <li>
                <h4>What can be improved?</h4>
                <p>A clearer website that is easier to navigate with detailed explanations and demos rather than being
                    overly flashy hard to understand. Instead of a lot of menus I think just being able to scroll all
                    the way down through each project would be a better format with links to jump to each project on the
                    side.</p>
